compiler_gym.leaderboard
========================

We provide `leaderboards
<https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#leaderboards>`_ to track the
performance of user-submitted algorithms on CompilerGym tasks. The goal of the
leaderboards is to provide a venue for researchers to promote their work, and to
provide a common benchmark for evaluating approaches. The
:code:`compiler_gym.leaderboard` module contains helper submodules that can be
used for preparing leaderboard submissions.
