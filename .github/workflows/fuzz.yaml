# This file defines a GitHub actions job that runs the fuzzing test suite for
# 10 minutes every weekday against the latest CompilerGym release. The job can
# also be scheduled manually using the GitHub actions UI.
#
# TODO(cummins): Set up https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue
# to create a boilerplate issue if `make fuzz` fails.
